# notam_check
NOTAM check tool, check it only ones

This tool imports NOTAMS from the ICAO API. Afterwards the NOTAMS are presented to the user. The user can then check the NOTAMS.
Checked NOTAMS are then set as checked. The goal is that every NOTAM is initially checked by one user. 
If the NOTAM has no relvance for the operation the NOTAM is not shown again.

# Webapp
Currently I my goal is to build a webapp which will replace the webapp version.
This will be my second webapp so it will look very messy I guess. I am looking for help/contributions of any kind
